# Contributing to the DeepSparse Engine

If you’re reading this, hopefully we have piqued your interest to take the next step. Join us and help make the DeepSparse Engine even better! As a contributor, here are some community guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
- [Ways to Contribute](#ways-to-contribute)
- [Bugs and Feature Requests](#bugs-and-feature-requests)
- [Question or Problem](#question-or-problem)
- [Developing the DeepSparse Engine](DEVELOPING.md)

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep the software inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in order to promote an environment that is friendly, fair, respectful, and safe. We want to inspire collaboration, innovation, and fun!

## Ways to Contribute

Whether you’re a newbie, dabbler, or expert, we appreciate you jumping in.

### Contributing Code

- Make pull requests for addressing bugs, open issues, and documentation
- Neural Magic as the maintainer will do reviews and final merge

### Reporting In

- See something, say something: bugs, documentation
- Propose new feature requests to Neural Magic

### Helping Others

- Answer open discussion topics
- Spread the word about the DeepSparse Engine
- Teach and empower others. This is the way!

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Please search through existing issues and requests first to avoid duplicates. Neural Magic will work with you further to take next steps.

- Go to: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/issues)</br>

For bugs, include:

- brief summary
- OS/Environment details
- steps to reproduce (s.t.r.)
- code snippets, screenshots/casts, log content, sample models
- add the GitHub label "bug" to your post

For feature requests, including the DeepSparse Engine, include:

- problem you’re trying to solve
- community benefits
- other relevant details to support your proposal
- add the GitHub label "enhancement" to your post

For documentation edits, include:

- current state, proposed state
- if applicable, screenshots/casts
- add the GitHub label "documentation" to your post

## Question or Problem

- Sign up or log in: **Deep Sparse Community** [Discourse Forum](https://discuss.neuralmagic.com/) and/or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/discuss-neuralmagic/shared_invite/zt-q1a1cnvo-YBoICSIw3L1dmQpjBeDurQ). We are growing the community member by member and happy to see you there.

Post all other questions including support or how to contribute. Don’t forget to search through existing discussions to avoid duplication! Thanks!

## Developing the DeepSparse Engine

Because the DeepSparse Engine algorithms are proprietary, code contributions cannot be made. However, there are other options to contribute to the engine's Python API wrapper code. Review [Developing the DeepSparse Engine](DEVELOPING.md) to get started.

We also welcome community input to bugs, feature requests, questions and problems as mentioned above.
