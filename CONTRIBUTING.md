 ## Bugs and Feature Requests
 - Check out [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/neuralmagic/engine/issues) for reporting bugs and feature requests

Prior to creating an issue, please search through existing issues so that you are not creating duplicate ones. 

If it’s a bug, be sure to provide where applicable, the s.t.r. = steps to reproduce including any code snippets, screenshots, traceback if an exception was raised, log content, and/or sample model files. 

If proposing a feature request, share the problem you’re trying to solve, community benefits, and other relevant details to support your proposal.

If you want to contribute a model, start with sharing a brief introduction at [GitHub Discussions under Ideas](https://github.com/neuralmagic/engine/discussions/categories/ideas). Fellow Neural Magic engineers can work with your further to take next steps.

 ## Question or Problem
 - Post a topic to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/neuralmagic/engine/discussions/) for all other questions including support or how to contribute

Don’t forget to search through existing discussions to avoid duplicating posts! Thanks!

## How to Contribute
