Description:
    Middlwares are used to as an intermediate step for a desired function to
     carry out anynecessary logic. Ex. Logging, timing, authentication, ...
    Pipeline and Operator use Middleware, but middlewares logic is not a core
     functionality of Operator or Pipeline. That is, Pipeline(s) and Operator(s)
     can run without middlewares, and their outputs should be the same
     using middlewares

Lifecycle:
    Vanilla Pipeline:
        Pipeline -> Pipeline.__call__() -> Pipeline.run() -> ...

    Pipeline + Middleware:
        Pipeline -> Pipeline.__call__()
            -> Middleware
                -> Pipeline.run()
            -> Middleware
        -> ...

     Pipeline + Middleware, Operator + Middleware:
        Pipeline -> Pipeline.__call__()
            -> Middleware (for pipeline start)
                -> Pipeline.run()
                    -> Middleware (for operator start)
                        -> Operator.run()
                    -> Middleware (for operator end)
            -> Middleware (for pipeline end)
        -> ...

Usage:
    Please check tests/deepsparse/middlewares
