# haystack_reqs.py
#
# This file is used to control which dependencies are installed by
# deepsparse[haystack]. This is done to ensure that farm-haystack has all of its
# dependencies without installing dependencies that conflict with NM.
#
# This file lists dependencies for farm-haystack[all]==1.4.0, excluding the following
# which conflict with deepsparse dependencies:
# [transformers]
# the following versions have been updated to match deepsparse and sparseml versioning
# [torch]
# you can see their haystack versions as comments in this file
#
# because haystack cannot be included in setup.py without its inclusion also causing
# an installation of huggingface/transformers, it will be auto installed through
# deepsparse/transformers/haystack/__init__.py
