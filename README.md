For details of training sparse models for deployment with DeepSparse, [check out SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).

### âœ¨NEWâœ¨ DeepSparse ARM Alpha ðŸ’ª

Neural Magic is bringing performant deep learning inference to ARM CPUs! In our recent product release, we launched alpha support for DeepSparse on AWS Graviton and Ampere. We are working towards a general release across ARM server, embedded, and mobile platforms in 2023.

**If you would like to trial the alpha or want early access to the general release, [sign up for the waitlist](https://neuralmagic.com/deepsparse-arm-waitlist/).**

## Installation

DeepSparse is available in two editions: 
1. DeepSparse Community is free for evaluation, research, and non-production use with our [DeepSparse Community License](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/engine-license-agreement/).
2. DeepSparse Enterprise requires a [trial license](https://neuralmagic.com/deepsparse-free-trial/) or [can be fully licensed](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/master-software-license-and-service-agreement/) for production, commercial applications.

#### Install via Docker (Recommended)

DeepSparse Community is available as a container image hosted on [GitHub container registry](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/pkgs/container/deepsparse).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/neuralmagic/deepsparse:1.4.2
docker tag ghcr.io/neuralmagic/deepsparse:1.4.2 deepsparse-docker
docker run -it deepsparse-docker
```

- [Check out the Docker page](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docker/) for more details.

#### Install via PyPI
DeepSparse Community is also available via PyPI. We recommend using a virtual enviornment.

```bash
pip install deepsparse
```

- [Check out the Installation page](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/user-guide/installation.md) for optional dependencies.

## Hardware Support and System Requirements

[Supported Hardware for DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/user-guide/hardware-support.md)

DeepSparse is tested on Python versions 3.8-3.10, ONNX versions 1.5.0-1.12.0, ONNX opset version 11 or higher, and manylinux compliant systems. Please note that DeepSparse is only supported natively on Linux. For those using Mac or Windows, running Linux in a Docker or virtual machine is necessary to use DeepSparse.

## Deployment APIs

DeepSparse includes three deployment APIs:

- **Engine** is the lowest-level API. With Engine, you pass tensors and receive the raw logits.
- **Pipeline** wraps the Engine with pre- and post-processing. With Pipeline, you pass raw data and receive the prediction.
- **Server** wraps Pipelines with a REST API using FastAPI. With Server, you send raw data over HTTP and receive the prediction.

### Engine

The example below downloads a 90% pruned-quantized BERT model for sentiment analysis in ONNX format from SparseZoo, compiles the model, and runs inference on randomly generated input.

```python
from deepsparse import Engine
from deepsparse.utils import generate_random_inputs, model_to_path

# download onnx, compile
zoo_stub = "zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none"
batch_size = 1
compiled_model = Engine(model=zoo_stub, batch_size=batch_size)

# run inference (input is raw numpy tensors, output is raw scores)
inputs = generate_random_inputs(model_to_path(zoo_stub), batch_size)
output = compiled_model(inputs)
print(output)

# > [array([[-0.3380675 ,  0.09602544]], dtype=float32)] << raw scores
```

### DeepSparse Pipelines

Pipeline is the default API for interacting with DeepSparse. Similar to Hugging Face Pipelines, DeepSparse Pipelines wrap Engine with pre- and post-processing (as well as other utilities), enabling you to send raw data to DeepSparse and receive the post-processed prediction.

The example below downloads a 90% pruned-quantized BERT model for sentiment analysis in ONNX format from SparseZoo, sets up a pipeline, and runs inference on sample data.

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

# download onnx, set up pipeline
zoo_stub = "zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none"  
sentiment_analysis_pipeline = Pipeline.create(
  task="sentiment-analysis",    # name of the task
  model_path=zoo_stub,          # zoo stub or path to local onnx file
)

# run inference (input is a sentence, output is the prediction)
prediction = sentiment_analysis_pipeline("I love using DeepSparse Pipelines")
print(prediction)
# > labels=['positive'] scores=[0.9954759478569031]
```

#### Additional Resources 
- Check out the [Use Cases Page](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/use-cases) for more details on supported tasks.
- Check out the [Pipelines User Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/user-guide/deepsparse-pipelines.md) for more usage details.

### DeepSparse Server

Server wraps Pipelines with REST APIs, enabling you to stand up model serving endpoint running DeepSparse. This enables you to send raw data to DeepSparse over HTTP and receive the post-processed predictions.

DeepSparse Server is launched from the command line, configured via arguments or a server configuration file. The following downloads a 90% pruned-quantized BERT model for sentiment analysis in ONNX format from SparseZoo and launches a sentiment analysis endpoint:

```bash
deepsparse.server \
  --task sentiment-analysis \
  --model_path zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none
```

Sending a request:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5543/predict" # Server's port default to 5543
obj = {"sequences": "Snorlax loves my Tesla!"}

response = requests.post(url, json=obj)
print(response.text)
# {"labels":["positive"],"scores":[0.9965094327926636]}
```

#### Additional Resources 
- Check out the [Use Cases Page](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/use-cases) for more details on supported tasks.
- Check out the [Server User Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/user-guide/deepsparse-server.md) for more usage details.

## ONNX

DeepSparse accepts models in the ONNX format. ONNX models can be passed in one of two ways:

- **SparseZoo Stub**: [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/) is an open-source repository of sparse models. The examples on this page use SparseZoo stubs to identify models and download them for deployment in DeepSparse.

- **Local ONNX File**: Users can provide their own ONNX models, whether dense or sparse. For example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx
```

```python
from deepsparse import Engine
from deepsparse.utils import generate_random_inputs
onnx_filepath = "mobilenetv2-7.onnx"
batch_size = 16

# Generate random sample input
inputs = generate_random_inputs(onnx_filepath, batch_size)

# Compile and run
compiled_model = Engine(model=onnx_filepath, batch_size=batch_size)
outputs = compiled_model(inputs)
print(outputs[0].shape)
# (16, 1000) << batch, num_classes
```

## Inference Modes

DeepSparse offers different inference scenarios based on your use case.

**Single-stream** scheduling: the latency/synchronous scenario, requests execute serially. [`default`]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/old/source/single-stream.png" alt="single stream diagram" />

It's highly optimized for minimum per-request latency, using all of the system's resources provided to it on every request it gets.

**Multi-stream** scheduling: the throughput/asynchronous scenario, requests execute in parallel.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/old/source/multi-stream.png" alt="multi stream diagram" />

The most common use cases for the multi-stream scheduler are where parallelism is low with respect to core count, and where requests need to be made asynchronously without time to batch them.

- [Check out the Scheduler User Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/user-guide/scheduler.md) for more details.

## Product Usage Analytics
DeepSparse Community Edition gathers basic usage telemetry including, but not limited to, Invocations, Package, Version, and IP Address for Product Usage Analytics purposes. Review Neural Magic's [Products Privacy Policy](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/) for further details on how we process this data.

To disable Product Usage Analytics, run the command:
```bash
export NM_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=True
```

Confirm that telemetry is shut off through info logs streamed with engine invocation by looking for the phrase "Skipping Neural Magic's latest package version check." For additional assistance, reach out through the [DeepSparse GitHub Issue queue](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/issues).
