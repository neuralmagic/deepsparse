A CPU runtime that takes advantage of sparsity within neural networks to reduce compute. Read more about sparsification [here](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/main/source/getstarted.html#sparsification).

Neural Magic's DeepSparse Engine is able to integrate into popular deep learning libraries (e.g., Hugging Face, Ultralytics) allowing you to leverage DeepSparse for loading and deploying sparse models with ONNX. ONNX gives the flexibility to serve your model in a framework-agnostic environment. Support includes [PyTorch,](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html) [TensorFlow,](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) [Keras,](https://github.com/onnx/keras-onnx) and [many other frameworks](https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools).

## Features

- 🔌 [DeepSparse Server](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/server)
- 📜 [DeepSparse Benchmark](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/benchmark)
- 👩‍💻 [NLP and Computer Vision Tasks Supported](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/examples)
- 🧰 [CPU Hardware Support for Various Architectures](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/deepsparse/source/hardware.html)

## Installation
The DeepSparse Engine is tested on Python 3.6-3.9, ONNX 1.5.0-1.10.1, ONNX opset version 11+, and manylinux compliant. Using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended. Install the engine using the following command:

```bash
pip install deepsparse
```

## 🔌 DeepSparse Server

The DeepSparse Server allows you to serve models and pipelines from the terminal. The server runs on top of the popular FastAPI web framework and Uvicorn web server. Install the server using the following command:

```bash
pip install deepsparse[server]
```

### Single Model

Once installed, the following example CLI command is available for running inference with a single BERT model:

```bash
deepsparse.server \
    --task question_answering \
    --model_path "zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni"
```

To look up arguments run: `deepsparse.server --help`.

### Multiple Models
To serve multiple models in your deployment you can easily build a `config.yaml`. In the example below, we define two BERT models in our configuration for the question answering task:

```yaml
models:
    - task: question_answering
      model_path: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/base-none
      batch_size: 1
      alias: question_answering/base
    - task: question_answering
      model_path: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni
      batch_size: 1
      alias: question_answering/pruned_quant
```

Finally, after your `config.yaml` file is built, run the server with the config file path as an argument:
```bash
deepsparse.server --config_file config.yaml
```

[Getting Started with the DeepSparse Server](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/server) for more info.

## 📜 DeepSparse Benchmark

The benchmark tool is available on your CLI to run expressive model benchmarks on the DeepSparse Engine with minimal parameters.

Run `deepsparse.benchmark -h` to look up arguments:

```shell
deepsparse.benchmark [-h] [-b BATCH_SIZE] [-shapes INPUT_SHAPES]
                          [-ncores NUM_CORES] [-s {async,sync}] [-t TIME]
                          [-nstreams NUM_STREAMS] [-pin {none,core,numa}]
                          [-q] [-x EXPORT_PATH]
                          model_path

```

[Getting Started with CLI Benchmarking](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/benchmark) includes examples of select inference scenarios: 
- Synchronous (Single-stream) Scenario
- Asynchronous (Multi-stream) Scenario


## 👩‍💻 NLP Inference Example

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

# SparseZoo model stub or path to ONNX file
model_path = "zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni"

qa_pipeline = Pipeline.create(
    task="question-answering",
    model_path=model_path,
)

my_name = qa_pipeline(question="What's my name?", context="My name is Snorlax")
```

Tasks Supported: 
- [Token Classification: Named Entity Recognition](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-named-entity-recognition/)
- [Text Classification: Multi-Class](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-multi-class-text-classification/)

- [Question Answering](https://neuralmagic.com/use-cases/sparse-question-answering/)

## 🦉 SparseZoo ONNX vs. Custom ONNX Models

DeepSparse can accept ONNX models from two sources: 

- **SparseZoo ONNX**: our open-source collection of sparse models available for download. [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) hosts inference-optimized models, trained on repeatable sparsification recipes using state-of-the-art techniques from [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).

- **Custom ONNX**: your own ONNX model, can be dense or sparse. Plug in your model to compare performance with other solutions.

```bash
> wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx
Saving to: ‘mobilenetv2-7.onnx’
```

Custom ONNX Benchmark example:
```python
from deepsparse import compile_model
from deepsparse.utils import generate_random_inputs
onnx_filepath = "mobilenetv2-7.onnx"
batch_size = 16

# Generate random sample input
inputs = generate_random_inputs(onnx_filepath, batch_size)

# Compile and run
engine = compile_model(onnx_filepath, batch_size)
outputs = engine.run(inputs)
```

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) includes package APIs along with examples to quickly get started benchmarking and inferencing sparse models.

## Scheduling Single-Stream, Multi-Stream, and Elastic Inference

The DeepSparse Engine offers up to three types of inferences based on your use case. Read more details here: [Inference Types](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/docs/source/scheduler.md).

1 ⚡ Single-stream scheduling: the latency/synchronous scenario, requests execute serially. [`default`]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/single-stream.png" alt="single stream diagram" />

Use Case: It's highly optimized for minimum per-request latency, using all of the system's resources provided to it on every request it gets.

2 ⚡ Multi-stream scheduling: the throughput/asynchronous scenario, requests execute in parallel.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/multi-stream.png" alt="multi stream diagram" />

PRO TIP: The most common use cases for the multi-stream scheduler are where parallelism is low with respect to core count, and where requests need to be made asynchronously without time to batch them.

3 ⚡ Elastic scheduling: requests execute in parallel, but not multiplexed on individual NUMA nodes.

Use Case: A workload that might benefit from the elastic scheduler is one in which multiple requests need to be handled simultaneously, but where performance is hindered when those requests have to share an L3 cache.

## 🧰 CPU Hardware Support

With support for AVX2, AVX-512, and VNNI instruction sets, the DeepSparse Engine is validated to work on x86 Intel (Haswell generation and later) and AMD CPUs running Linux. Mac and Windows require running Linux in a Docker or virtual machine.

Here is a table detailing specific support for some algorithms over different microarchitectures:
