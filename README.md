## Overview

The DeepSparse Engine is a CPU runtime that delivers GPU-class performance by taking advantage of sparsity within neural networks to reduce compute required as well as accelerate memory bound workloads. 
It is focused on model deployment and scaling machine learning pipelines, fitting seamlessly into your existing deployments as an inference backend.

This repository includes package APIs along with examples to quickly get started benchmarking and inferencing sparse models. 

## Sparsification

Sparsification is the process of taking a trained deep learning model and removing redundant information from the overprecise and over-parameterized network resulting in a faster and smaller model.
Techniques for sparsification are all encompassing including everything from inducing sparsity using [pruning](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/pruning-overview/) and [quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07061) to enabling naturally occurring sparsity using [activation sparsity](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/kurtz20a.html) or [winograd/FFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09308). 
When implemented correctly, these techniques result in significantly more performant and smaller models with limited to no effect on the baseline metrics.
For example, pruning plus quantization can give noticeable improvements in performance while recovering to nearly the same baseline accuracy.

The Deep Sparse product suite builds on top of sparsification enabling you to easily apply the techniques to your datasets and models using recipe-driven approaches.
Recipes encode the directions for how to sparsify a model into a simple, easily editable format.
- Download a sparsification recipe and sparsified model from the [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo).
- Alternatively, create a recipe for your model using [Sparsify](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify).
- Apply your recipe with only a few lines of code using [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).
- Finally, for GPU-level performance on CPUs, deploy your sparse-quantized model with the [DeepSparse Engine](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse).

## Compatibility

The DeepSparse Engine ingests models in the [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format, allowing for compatibility with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx), [Keras](https://github.com/onnx/keras-onnx), and [many other frameworks](https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools) that support it. This reduces the extra work of preparing your trained model for inference to just one step of exporting.

## Quick Tour

To expedite inference and benchmarking on real models, we include the `sparsezoo` package. [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) hosts inference-optimized models, trained on repeatable sparsification recipes using state-of-the-art techniques from [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).

### Quickstart with SparseZoo ONNX Models

**ResNet-50 Dense**

Here is how to quickly perform inference with DeepSparse Engine on a pre-trained dense ResNet-50 from SparseZoo.

```python
from deepsparse import compile_model
from sparsezoo.models import classification

batch_size = 64

# Download model and compile as optimized executable for your machine
model = classification.resnet_50()
engine = compile_model(model, batch_size=batch_size)

# Fetch sample input and predict output using engine
inputs = model.data_inputs.sample_batch(batch_size=batch_size)
outputs, inference_time = engine.timed_run(inputs)
```

**ResNet-50 Sparsified**

When exploring available optimized models, you can use the `Zoo.search_optimized_models` utility to find models that share a base.

Try this on the dense ResNet-50 to see what is available:

```python
from sparsezoo import Zoo
from sparsezoo.models import classification

model = classification.resnet_50()
print(Zoo.search_sparse_models(model))
```

Output:

```shell
[
    Model(stub=cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned-conservative), 
    Model(stub=cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned-moderate), 
    Model(stub=cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned_quant-moderate), 
    Model(stub=cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet-augmented/pruned_quant-aggressive)
]
```

We can see there are two pruned versions targeting FP32 and two pruned, quantized versions targeting INT8.
The `conservative`, `moderate`, and `aggressive` tags recover to 100%, >=99%, and <99% of baseline accuracy respectively.

For a version of ResNet-50 that recovers close to the baseline and is very performant, choose the pruned_quant-moderate model.
This model will run [nearly 7x faster](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/benchmark-resnet50-with-deepsparse) than the baseline model on a compatible CPU (with the VNNI instruction set enabled).
For hardware compatibility, see the Hardware Support section.

```python
from deepsparse import compile_model
import numpy

batch_size = 64
sample_inputs = [numpy.random.randn(batch_size, 3, 224, 224).astype(numpy.float32)]

# run baseline benchmarking
engine_base = compile_model(
    model="zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/base-none", 
    batch_size=batch_size,
)
benchmarks_base = engine_base.benchmark(sample_inputs)
print(benchmarks_base)

# run sparse benchmarking
engine_sparse = compile_model(
    model="zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned_quant-moderate", 
    batch_size=batch_size,
)
if not engine_sparse.cpu_vnni:
    print("WARNING: VNNI instructions not detected, quantization speedup not well supported")
benchmarks_sparse = engine_sparse.benchmark(sample_inputs)
print(benchmarks_sparse)

print(f"Speedup: {benchmarks_sparse.items_per_second / benchmarks_base.items_per_second:.2f}x")
```

### Quickstart with Custom ONNX Models

We accept ONNX files for custom models, too. Simply plug in your model to compare performance with other solutions.

```bash
> wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/master/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx
Saving to: ‘mobilenetv2-7.onnx’
```

```python
from deepsparse import compile_model
from deepsparse.utils import generate_random_inputs
onnx_filepath = "mobilenetv2-7.onnx"
batch_size = 16

# Generate random sample input
inputs = generate_random_inputs(onnx_filepath, batch_size)

# Compile and run
engine = compile_model(onnx_filepath, batch_size)
outputs = engine.run(inputs)
```

    abstract = {Optimizing convolutional neural networks for fast inference has recently become an extremely active area of research. One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.}
