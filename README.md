## Overview

The DeepSparse Engine is a CPU runtime that delivers unprecedented performance by taking advantage of natural sparsity within neural networks to reduce compute required as well as accelerate memory bound processes.

It includes a CPU inference engine, ONNX conversion tooling, and model server if needed. It's focused on model deployment and scaling machine learning pipelines, fitting seamlessly into your existing deployment processes.

This repository contains information on how to download the binary under the terms of the Neural Magic Engine License as well as the API which interfaces with the compiled deepsparse_engine library. [TODO ENGINEERING: REVIEW]

One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.} }
