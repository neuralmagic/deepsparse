[DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) is a CPU inference runtime that takes advantage of sparsity to accelerate neural network inference. Coupled with [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml), our optimization library for pruning and quantizing your models, DeepSparse delivers exceptional inference performance on CPU hardware.

## ✨NEW✨ DeepSparse LLMs

We are excited to announce initial support for performant LLM inference in DeepSparse with:
- Sparse kernels for speedups and memory savings from unstructured sparse weights
- 8-bit weight and activation quantization support
- Efficient usage of cached attention keys and values for minimal memory movement

![mpt-chat-comparison](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/assets/3195154/ccf39323-4603-4489-8462-7b103872aeb3)

### Try It Now

Install (requires Linux):
```bash
pip install -U deepsparse-nightly[llm]
```

Run inference:
```python
from deepsparse import TextGeneration
pipeline = TextGeneration(model="zoo:mpt-7b-dolly_mpt_pretrain-pruned50_quantized")

prompt="""
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request. ### Instruction: what is sparsity? ### Response:
"""
print(pipeline(prompt, max_new_tokens=75).generations[0].text)

# Sparsity is the property of a matrix or other data structure in which a large number of elements are zero, and a smaller number of elements are non-zero. In the context of machine learning, sparsity can be used to improve the efficiency of training and prediction.
```

> [Check out the `TextGeneration` documentation for usage details.](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/docs/llms/text-generation-pipeline.md)

### Sparsity :handshake: Performance

Developed in collaboration with IST Austria, [our recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06927) details a new technique called **Sparse Finetuning**, which allows us to prune MPT-7B to 60% sparsity during finetuning without drop in accuracy. With our new support for LLMs, DeepSparse accelerates the sparse-quantized model 7x over the dense baseline:

> [Check out the model running live on Hugging Face.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/neuralmagic/sparse-mpt-7b-gsm8k)

### LLM Roadmap

Following this initial launch, we are rapidly expanding our support for LLMs, including:

1. Productizing Sparse Finetuning: Enable external users to apply the sparse fine-tuning to their datasets via SparseML
2. Expanding Model Support: Apply our sparse finetuning results to Llama2 and Mistral models
3. Pushing to Higher Sparsity: Improving our pruning algorithms to reach even higher sparsity

## Computer Vision and NLP Models

In addition to LLMs, DeepSparse supports many variants of CNNs and Transformer models such as BERT, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNet, YOLOv5/8, and many more! Take a look at the [Computer Vision](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?modelSet=computer_vision) and [Natural Language Processing](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?modelSet=natural_language_processing) domains of [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/), our home for optimized models.

### Installation

Install via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deepsparse/) ([optional dependencies detailed here](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/user-guide/installation.md)):

```bash
pip install deepsparse 
```

To experiment with the latest features, there is a nightly build available using `pip install deepsparse-nightly` or you can clone + install from source using `pip install -e path/to/deepsparse`.

#### System Requirements
- Hardware: [x86 AVX2, AVX512, AVX512-VNNI and ARM v8.2+](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/docs/user-guide/hardware-support.md)
- Operating System: Linux
- Python: 3.8-3.11
- ONNX versions 1.5.0-1.15.0, ONNX opset version 11 or higher

For those using Mac or Windows, we recommend using Linux Containers with Docker.

## Deployment APIs

DeepSparse includes three deployment APIs:

- **Engine** is the lowest-level API. With Engine, you compile an ONNX model, pass tensors as input, and receive the raw outputs.
- **Pipeline** wraps the Engine with pre- and post-processing. With Pipeline, you pass raw data and receive the prediction.
- **Server** wraps Pipelines with a REST API using FastAPI. With Server, you send raw data over HTTP and receive the prediction.

### Engine

The example below downloads a 90% pruned-quantized BERT model for sentiment analysis in ONNX format from SparseZoo, compiles the model, and runs inference on randomly generated input. Users can provide their own ONNX models, whether dense or sparse.

```python
from deepsparse import Engine

# download onnx, compile
zoo_stub = "zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none"
compiled_model = Engine(model=zoo_stub, batch_size=1)

# run inference (input is raw numpy tensors, output is raw scores)
inputs = compiled_model.generate_random_inputs()
output = compiled_model(inputs)
print(output)

# > [array([[-0.3380675 ,  0.09602544]], dtype=float32)] << raw scores
```

### Pipeline

Pipelines wrap Engine with pre- and post-processing, enabling you to pass raw data and receive the post-processed prediction. The example below downloads a 90% pruned-quantized BERT model for sentiment analysis in ONNX format from SparseZoo, sets up a pipeline, and runs inference on sample data.

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

# download onnx, set up pipeline
zoo_stub = "zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none"  
sentiment_analysis_pipeline = Pipeline.create(
  task="sentiment-analysis",    # name of the task
  model_path=zoo_stub,          # zoo stub or path to local onnx file
)

# run inference (input is a sentence, output is the prediction)
prediction = sentiment_analysis_pipeline("I love using DeepSparse Pipelines")
print(prediction)
# > labels=['positive'] scores=[0.9954759478569031]
```

### Server

Server wraps Pipelines with REST APIs, enabling you to stand up model serving endpoint running DeepSparse. This enables you to send raw data to DeepSparse over HTTP and receive the post-processed predictions. DeepSparse Server is launched from the command line, configured via arguments or a server configuration file. The following downloads a 90% pruned-quantized BERT model for sentiment analysis in ONNX format from SparseZoo and launches a sentiment analysis endpoint:

```bash
deepsparse.server \
  --task sentiment-analysis \
  --model_path zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/obert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/pruned90_quant-none
```

Sending a request:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5543/v2/models/sentiment_analysis/infer" # Server's port default to 5543
obj = {"sequences": "Snorlax loves my Tesla!"}

response = requests.post(url, json=obj)
print(response.text)
# {"labels":["positive"],"scores":[0.9965094327926636]}
```

## Product Usage Analytics

DeepSparse gathers basic usage telemetry including, but not limited to, Invocations, Package, Version, and IP Address for Product Usage Analytics purposes. Review Neural Magic's [Products Privacy Policy](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/) for further details on how we process this data. 

To disable Product Usage Analytics, run:
```bash
export NM_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=True
```

Confirm that telemetry is shut off through info logs streamed with engine invocation by looking for the phrase "Skipping Neural Magic's latest package version check."
