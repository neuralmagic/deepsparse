Overview
========

The DeepSparse Engine is a CPU runtime that delivers unprecedented performance by taking advantage of
natural sparsity within neural networks to reduce compute required as well as accelerate memory bound workloads.
It is focused on model deployment and scaling machine learning pipelines,
fitting seamlessly into your existing deployments as an inference backend.

`This GitHub repository <https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse />`_ includes package APIs along with examples to quickly get started learning about and
actually running sparse models.

Compatibility
=============

The DeepSparse Engine ingests models in the `ONNX <https://onnx.ai/ />`_ format,
allowing for compatibility with `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html />`_,
`TensorFlow <https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx />`_, `Keras <https://github.com/onnx/keras-onnx />`_,
and `many other frameworks <https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools />`_ that support it.
This reduces the extra work of preparing your trained model for inference to just one step of exporting.
