# YOLACT DeepSparse Inference Examples
This directory contains examples of benchmarking, annotating using YOLACT segmentation models from the [dbolya/yolact](https://github.com/dbolya/yolact) repositories using the DeepSparse Engine. 
The DeepSparse Engine achieves [real-time inferencing of YOLACT on CPUs]() by leveraging sparse-quantized YOLACT models. 
These examples can load pre-trained, sparsified models from [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) or a custom-trained model created using the [SparseML YOLACT integration](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml/blob/main/integrations/yolact/README.md).

## Installation
The [Neural Magic YOLACT Fork](https://github.com/neuralmagic/yolact) is modified to make annotation and benchmarking using the DeepSparse Engine easier. To begin, run the following command in the root directory of this example (`cd examples/dbolya-yolact`).

```bash
bash setup_integration.sh
```

Note: if you run into issues, try upgrading pip using `python -m pip install -U pip` before running the setup. 
We also recommend creating a `virtualenv` to keep project dependencies isolated.

## SparseZoo Stubs

The following examples may be run with local ONNX YOLACT models or by using pre-trained, pre-sparsified models
from the [SparseZoo](https://staging-sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?domain=cv&sub_domain=segmentation&page=1).

[SparseZoo](https://staging-sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?domain=cv&sub_domain=segmentation&page=1) contains both 
baseline and models sparsified to different degrees of inference performance vs. baseline loss recovery.

Each model in the SparseZoo has a specific stub that identifies it; any YOLACT model stub in the SparseZoo can be used to
run the following examples.

| Sparsification Type | Description                                                                       | Zoo Stub                                                                     | COCO mAP@all | Size on Disk | DeepSparse Performance** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Baseline            | The baseline, pretrained model on the COCO dataset.                               | zoo:cv/segmentation/yolact-darknet53/pytorch/dbolya/coco/base-none           | 0.288        | 170 MB       | -- img/sec               |
| Pruned              | A highly sparse, FP32 model that recovers close to the baseline model.            | zoo:cv/segmentation/yolact-darknet53/pytorch/dbolya/coco/pruned90-none       | 0.286        | 30.1 MB      | -- img/sec               |
| Pruned Quantized    | A highly sparse, INT8 model that recovers reasonably close to the baseline model. | zoo:cv/segmentation/yolact-darknet53/pytorch/dbolya/coco/pruned82_quant-none | 0.282        | 9.7 MB       | -- img/sec               |

## Annotation Example

`eval.py` inside the `yolact` repository has been updated for using YOLACT sparsified (or non-sparsified) models
to run inferences on images, videos, or webcam streams. For a full list of options
`python eval.py -h`.

To run image segmentation using YOLACT with DeepSparse on a local webcam run:
```bash
python eval.py \
    --trained_model PATH_OR_STUB_TO_YOLACT_ONNX \
    --source 0 
```

In addition to a webcam, `eval.py` can take a path to a `.jpg` file, directory, 
or path to a `.mp4` video file.  If the source is an integer and no
 corresponding webcam is available, an exception will be raised.


## Benchmarking Example
`eval.py` can also be used to benchmark sparsified and quantized YOLACT
performance with DeepSparse.  For a full list of options run `python eval.py -h`.

To run a benchmark simply pass in the `--benchmark` flag while calling the script:
```bash
python eval.py \
    --trained_model PATH_OR_STUB_TO_YOLACT_ONNX \
    --source PATH_TO_IMAGE_DIRECTORY \
    --benchmark
```

Note: for quantized performance, your CPU must support VNNI instructions.
Review `/proc/cpuinfo` for the flag `avx512_vnni` to verify chipset compatibility.
