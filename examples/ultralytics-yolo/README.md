# Ultralytics YOLO DeepSparse Inference Examples
This directory contains examples of benchmarking, annotating, and serving inferences
of YOLO models from the [ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3)
and [ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
repositories using the DeepSparse Engine. The DeepSparse Engine is able to achieve
[real-time inferencing of YOLO on CPUs](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/benchmark-yolov3-on-cpus-with-deepsparse/)
by leveraging pruned and quantized YOLO models. These examples can load pre-trained,
sparsified models from [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) or you can
create your own using the 
[Sparseml-Ultralytics-yolov5 integration](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml/blob/main/integrations/ultralytics-yolov5/README.md).

## Installation
The dependencies for this example can be installed using `pip`:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## SparseZoo Stubs
The following examples may be run with local ONNX YOLO models, or by using pre-trained, pre-sparsified YOLO models
from the [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/).

The [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/) contains both 
baseline and models sparsified to different degrees of inference performance vs. baseline loss recovery.

Each model in the SparseZoo has a specific stub that identifies it; any YOLO model stub in the SparseZoo can be used to
run the following examples.


| Model Name     |      Stub      | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| yolov3-pruned-aggressive | zoo:cv/detection/yolo_v3-spp/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned-aggressive_97 | Sparse YOLOv3 model train with full FP32 precision that recovers 97% of its baseline mAP |
| yolov3-pruned_quant-aggressive | zoo:cv/detection/yolo_v3-spp/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned_quant-aggressive_94 | Sparse INT8 quantized YOLOv3 model that recovers 94% of its baseline mAP |
| yolov3-base | zoo:cv/detection/yolo_v3-spp/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/base-none | Dense full precision YOLOv3-SPP model |


## Annotation Example
`annotate.py` is a script for using YOLO sparsified (and not sparsified) models
to run inferences on images, videos, or webcam streams. For a full list of options
`python annotate.py -h`.

To run pruned-quantized YOLOv3 on a local webcam run:
```bash
python annotate.py \
    zoo:cv/detection/yolo_v3-spp/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned_quant-aggressive_94 \
    --source 0 \
    --quantized-inputs \
    --image-shape 416 416 \
    --no-save  # webcam only
```

In addition to webcam `--source` can take a path to a `.jpg` file, directory or glob path
of `.jpg` files, or path to a `.mp4` video file.  If source is an integer and no
corresponding webcam is available, an exception will be raised.


## Benchmarking Example
`benchmark.py` is a script for benchmarking sparsified and quantized YOLO
performance with DeepSparse.  For a full list of options run `python benchmark.py -h`.

To run a benchmark run:
```bash
python benchmark.py \
    zoo:cv/detection/yolo_v3-spp/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned_quant-aggressive_94 \
    --batch-size 1 \
    --quantized-inputs
```

Note for quantized performance, your CPU must support VNNI instructions.
Review `/proc/cpuinfo` for the flag `avx512_vnni` to verify chipset compatibility.



## Example YOLO DeepSparse Flask Server

To illustrate how the DeepSparse Engine can be used for YOLO model deployments, this directory
contains a sample model server and client. 

The server uses Flask to create an app with the DeepSparse Engine hosting a
compiled YOLO model.
The client can make requests into the server returning object detection results for given images.

### Server

First, start up the host `server.py` with your model of choice, SparseZoo stubs are
also supported.

Example command:
```bash
python server.py \
    zoo:cv/detection/yolo_v3-spp/pytorch/ultralytics/coco/pruned_quant-aggressive_94 \
    --quantized-inputs
```

You can leave that running as a detached process or in a spare terminal.

This starts a Flask app with the DeepSparse Engine as the inference backend, accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:5543` by default.

The app exposes HTTP endpoints at:
- `/info` to get information about the compiled model
- `/predict` to send images to the model and receive as detected in response.
    The number of images should match the compiled model's batch size.

http://0.0.0.0:5543 is the default url and the user can also specify their own url while running the server.
For a full list of options, run `python server.py -h`.

Currently, the server is set to do pre-processing for the yolov3-spp
model; if other models are used, the image shape, output shapes, and
anchor grids should be updated. 

### Client

`client.py` provides a `YoloDetectionClient` object to make requests to the server easy.
The file is self-documented.  See example usage below:

```python
from client import YoloDetectionClient

remote_model = YoloDetectionClient()
image_path = "/PATH/TO/EXAMPLE/IMAGE.jpg"

model_outputs = remote_model.detect(image_path)
```
