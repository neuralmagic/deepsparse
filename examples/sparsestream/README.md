      *** SparseStream classifies the sentiment and topic of finance-related tweets in a real-time stream. ***


## `INTRO`

The purpose of this app is for you to familiarize yourself with the high performance inference speeds of sparse models in a streaming environment. You will be able to use this app to classify tweets in a real-time stream.

<br />

[Getting Started with the DeepSparse Engine](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse)

## `INSTALL`

Supports Python >= 3.7

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse.git
cd deepsparse/examples/sparsestream
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## `CONFIGURING API`

In order to connect with the Twitter streaming API, access to the `consumer key`, `consumer secret`, `access token` and `access token secret` is required before getting started. These tokens will be available after applying for a Twitter app via the [Twitter developer site](https://developer.twitter.com/en). Afterwards, add these four tokens to the `config.yaml` file before starting the stream.

## `START STREAM`

In a terminal, start a Twitter stream with:
```bash
python stream.py
```

This will download sparse-optimized models and initialize two NLP inference pipelines for the financial text classification task: one pipeline for sentiment classification and the other for topic classification.

## `STREAM WHILE YOU EAT SOME POPCORN üçø`

Tweets should now be streaming in your terminal, and you should see three objects per tweet:

- `tweet`: The tweet received from the Twitter API.
- `sentiment`: The tweet's sentiment: `Bullish` or `Bearish` or `Neutral`
- `topic`: The tweet's financial topic: Please refer to `labels.py` for a full list of the 20 topic labels.

For example:

```text
'Gold is up 25% in after-hours trading.'
'Bullish'
'Gold | Metals | Materials'
'Apple will introduce its new Ipad in November.'
'Neutral'
'Company | Product News'
'Goldman downgrades Twitter before Elon buyout.'
'Bearish'
'Analyst Update'
```
