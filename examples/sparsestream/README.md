      *** SparseStream classifies the sentiment and topic of finance-related tweets in a real-time stream. ***


## <div>`INTRO`</div>

<samp>

<div>
The purpose of this app is for you to familiarize yourself with the high performance inference speeds of sparse models in a streaming environment. You will be able to use this app to classify tweets in a real-time stream.
</div>

<br />

[Getting Started with the DeepSparse Engine](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse)

## <div>`INSTALL`</div>

Supports Python >= 3.7

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse.git
cd examples/sparsestream
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## <div>`START STREAM`</div>

In terminal, start a Twitter stream with:
```bash
python stream.py
```

This will download a Sparse ONNX model and initialize two NLP inference pipelines for the text classification task, one pipeline for sentiment classification, and the other for topic classification.

## <div>`STREAM WHILE YOU EAT SOME POPCORN üçø`</div>

Tweets should now be streaming in terminal, you should see three objects per tweet:

- `tweet`: The tweet received from the Twitter API.
- `sentiment`: The tweet's sentiment: `Bullish` or `Bearish` or `Neutral`
- `topic`: The tweet's financial topic: Please refer to `labels.py` for a full list of the 20 topic labels.

For example:

```text
'Gold is up 25% in after-hours trading.'
'Bullish'
'Gold | Metals | Materials'
```
