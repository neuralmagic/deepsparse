    "\n",
    "In [this blog post](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/benchmark-yolov3-on-cpus-with-deepsparse/) the Neural Magic team describes how achieving real-time inference speeds on [Ultralytic's YOLOv3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) using CPUs is possible. This notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough for using the [DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) Engine to attain and benchmark these speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs pre-sparsified models downloaded from the [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo). For information on creating custom sparsified YOLO models with [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml), check out the [SparseML-Ultralytics integration documentation](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml/blob/main/integrations/ultralytics/README.md).\n",
